## How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ Point your camera at printed text (e.g., a sign, document, or label)  
2Ô∏è‚É£ SeeSharp captures the image and processes it using AI models for text extraction  
3Ô∏è‚É£ The extracted text is read aloud using Google TTS, making information accessible in real-time  

SeeSharp does not rely on cloud-based location services for functionality. The camera + AI + TTS workflow works even in offline scenarios (except for text-to-speech services which may need an internet connection).
